# LEG

A more advanced architecture than OVERTURE, LEG was my my second computer architecture. Featuring more instructions, wide instructions, and memory, it is significantly easier to use (in no small part due to having more than 6 bytes of storable data). While I am currently working on an assembler and enhanced architecture, development of both has been haulted by college applications.

Fun fact: this shares conent with MIT OCW course 6.004.
